This repository contains data and code used for analysis and plotting of figures in the publication â€œThe lactonase BxdA mediates metabolic specialisation of maize root bacteria to benzoxazinoids" (Thoenen et al. 2024). 

The following figures or panels therein are produced with the scripts in the following folders. For the scripts to run properly, the working directory needs to be set to the source file location.

Bioinformatics:
The bioinformatic analyses and the code for producing Fig 4 are located here: https://github.com/makrez/Nature_bx_metabolisation_MS.git

Figures and/or individual parts thereof were exported from R, combined and finalised using Adobe Illustrator.
